# Insurance-Analysis-with-SQL
I used advanced querries to answer fundamental questions from an insurance dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ibrahimshahrukh/medical-insurance-cost-dataset-usa/data) with all tables attached. Further analyses (prediction modelling) will be done in R and uploaded as soon as they are ready.
